Environment‑Aware Best Practices
1. Dependency Control

ArcGIS Online uses a managed environment with pinned dependency versions.

    Avoid importing any external packages not preinstalled in AGO, and wrap optional imports:

python
try:
    from PIL import Image
except ImportError:
    Image = None

If development in VSCode requires additional debugging or visualization libraries (like rich, tqdm, or logging), isolate them behind environment checks:

    python
    import os
    DEV_ENV = os.environ.get("VSCODE_PID") is not None

    if DEV_ENV:
        print("Running in VSCode notebook environment")

2. Path and File Handling

ARC Online notebooks often have sandboxed storage limited to /arcgis/home/.

    Use

python
from pathlib import Path
BASE_DIR = Path.home()

and write all temporary or exported files under BASE_DIR / "notebook_data".

When debugging locally, allow development overrides:

    python
    if DEV_ENV:
        BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).parent / "_local_testing"

3. Authentication Separation

Avoid persistent login logic that depends on saved credentials.

    Let GIS("home") handle credentials on AGO.

    During VSCode development, fall back to developer credentials in AGOL_TEST_USER and AGOL_TEST_PW environment variables.

    Abstract this with:

    python
    def connect_gis():
        """
        Returns an authenticated GIS connection depending on environment.
        """
        if DEV_ENV:
            return GIS("https://www.arcgis.com", os.environ["AGOL_TEST_USER"], os.environ["AGOL_TEST_PW"])
        return GIS("home")

4. Debugging Tools

AGO’s notebook kernel prints errors minimally and hides full stack traces at times.

    In production cells, wrap operations in try/except with clear output strings that print traceback.format_exc() only if DEV_ENV is True.

    Keep verbose logging via your custom log_step() helper, but ensure messages are short enough not to flood the AGO output pane.

5. Output Controls

In AGO, ipywidgets and rich interactive UIs can sometimes fail to render fully.

    Retain widget-based interfaces for usability, but gate their creation:

    python
    if not DEV_ENV:
        display(widgets.VBox([...]))

    Add a simple command-line fallback for automation (e.g., flags or JSON-driven inputs).

6. File Organization

You can safely separate reusable code into a lightweight helper script such as storymap_utils.py, placed beside your notebook.

    In AGO, this will still import successfully as long as you upload it with the notebook.

    In VSCode, you gain the ability to test these functions directly and use standard debugging tools.

7. Memory and Performance

AGO notebooks have limited memory (currently ~9 GB RAM).

    Any large loops over StoryMap entries should include incremental saves or explicit gc.collect() calls to prevent kernel failures.

    Prefer smaller function scopes within with blocks to auto-close items and releases (e.g., with open(...) as f:).

Recommended Adjustments to the Refactor Plan
Category	    |   Adjustment
Logging     	|   Replace print calls with an environment‑sensitive log_step() that limits verbosity online.
Error Handling	|   Centralize try/except in a helper (e.g., safe_api_call(fn, *args)), printing full trace only in VSCode.
UI	            |   Keep interactive widgets but suppress layout logic in headless or automated AGO runs.
Testing     	|   Write small “unit test” cells in VSCode using mock GIS or JSON data to isolate functions.
Imports	        |   Group Esri imports (from arcgis.gis import GIS, etc.) at the top with comments on AGO availability.

Summary

By:

    Switching logging and optional import behavior based on environment,

    Using dynamic authentication and file paths,

    Keeping verbose documentation but simplifying UI dependencies,

your notebook will remain stable within ArcGIS Online’s managed execution environment, while staying developer‑friendly inside VSCode.

Following this approach preserves the structured, docstring‑rich, verbose-comment style you prefer, and guarantees smoother transitions between local debugging and production execution.


The updated version of your code is overall well-improved—it has consistent docstrings, structured function order, and verbose comments—but there remains significant duplication and opportunities for efficiency gains, especially in error-handling, thumbnail generation, and conversion utilities. The cleanup can focus on consolidating common logic and modularizing repeated workflows.

Below is a detailed evaluation:
Core Duplication and Optimization Areas
1. Safe Getter Functions (safe_get_json, safe_get_rest_json, safe_get_image)

All three perform “try → request → fallback” patterns. You could merge them into a generic helper:

python
def safe_request(handler, *args, **kwargs):
    """Generic safe wrapper for request or ArcGIS item methods."""
    try:
        return handler(*args, **kwargs)
    except Exception:
        return {} if "json" in handler.__name__ else None

Then define specific shims:

python
safe_get_json = lambda item: safe_request(lambda: json.loads(item.get_data()) if isinstance(item.get_data(), str) else item.get_data())
safe_get_rest_json = lambda url, params=None: safe_request(lambda: requests.get(url, params=params).json())
safe_get_image = lambda url: safe_request(requests.get, url)

That removes about 30 duplicated lines and centralizes fallback behavior.
2. Thumbnail Creation and Download

There are three near-identical functions:

    download_thumbnail

    create_image_thumbnail

    create_webmap_thumbnail (partial)

Unify into one generate_thumbnail() utility with a mode argument:

python
def generate_thumbnail(source, default_path, mode="image", gis=None, webmap_json=None):
    """
    Flexible helper for generating thumbnails.
    mode options: 'image', 'webmap', 'item'
    """
    try:
        if mode == "item" and gis:
            url = f"{gis._portal.resturl}content/items/{source.id}/info/{source.thumbnail}"
            response = requests.get(url, params={"token": gis._con.token})
        elif mode == "image":
            response = requests.get(source)
        elif mode == "webmap":
            image_url = call_print_service(webmap_json)
            response = requests.get(image_url)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported mode.")

        img = PILImage.open(BytesIO(response.content))
        temp_path = BASE_DIR / f"thumbnail_{uuid.uuid4().hex}.png"
        img.thumbnail((800, 600))
        img.save(temp_path)
        return str(temp_path)
    except Exception:
        return create_image_thumbnail(default_path, default_path)

create_webmap_thumbnail() can then delegate this helper, simplifying retry logic.
3. Redundant Conversion Logic in HTML Parsing

Functions like convert_color_style_to_class, process_html_colors_preserve_html, and convert_element_to_storymap_object duplicate string cleaning, tag traversal, and style removal steps. Consolidate with:

    A single color parsing utility (parse_color_to_class)

    A shared “tag cleaner” function to strip inline styles across all rich-text tags.

E.g.:

python
def apply_style_class(tag, property_name="color"):
    style = tag.get("style", "")
    match = re.search(fr"{property_name}\s*:\s*([^;]+)", style)
    if not match:
        return
    val = match.group(1).strip()
    class_color = f"sm-text-{property_name}-{color_to_hex(val)}"
    del tag["style"]
    tag["class"] = tag.get("class", []) + [class_color]

Then both color-related functions call this.
4. Repetition in Map/Extent Normalization Functions

Currently, normalize_webmercator_extent, fetch_extent_from_item, fill_missing_extents, and parts of build_webmap_from_json all handle extent normalization with slightly different logic.

You can consolidate everything into:

    normalize_extent(extent, default_sr=102100)

    infer_extent(entries, index)

    convert_to_webmercator_if_needed(extent)

and reuse these consistently.
5. Mainstage and StoryMap Creation Loops

create_and_save_storymaps() and build_and_save_storymap() have nested iteration and printing logic that can be simplified using the same output logger and loop control, e.g.:

python
for i, entry in enumerate(entries):
    log_step(f"[{i+1}/{len(entries)}] Building: {entry.get('title', 'Untitled')}")
    item, thumb = build_and_save_storymap(context, i)
    context["published_storymap_items"][i] = item
    context["thumbnail_paths"][i] = thumb

Combine create_storymaps() and create_and_save_storymaps() into a single streamlined loop with programmable output verbosity.
6. Folder and Item Management

check_folder, create_folder, move_item_to_folder, and move_items_to_folder share similar print() and error handling logic.
Suggested refactor: group all under a FolderManager class:

python
class FolderManager:
    def __init__(self, gis, context):
        self.gis = gis
        self.context = context

    def ensure_folder(self, name):
        folders = [f.name for f in self.gis.content.folders.list(self.gis.users.me.username)]
        if name not in folders:
            self.gis.content.folders.create(folder=name, owner=self.gis.users.me.username)
        return name

    def move_items(self, items):
        for item in items:
            try:
                item.move(self.context["folder_name"])
                log_step(f"Moved {item.title}")
            except Exception as e:
                log_step(f"Move failed: {e}")

This reduces UI-driven duplication while keeping behavior identical.
7. Repeated print Messaging

Multiple functions use print(f"Step #x complete...").
Centralize with a log_step() helper (from your earlier pseudocode plan) or use a verbosity setting in context (context["verbose"] = True).
8. Combine Redundant Exception Paths

There are many except Exception: blocks printing similar diagnostics. Abstract it:

python
def safe_exec(msg, fn, *args, **kwargs):
    try:
        return fn(*args, **kwargs)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[{msg}] {e}")
        return None

All error-prone steps like gis.content.get(), item.move(), and thumbnail requests can use this.
Quick Efficiency Wins

    Replace long nested try/excepts with contextlib.suppress()

    Cache frequently used values (e.g., context["gis"]._con.token) instead of recalculating per request.

    Convert deeply nested if/else HTML parsing into lookup dictionaries for “type → builder”.

Would you like a rewritten refactored code skeleton (e.g., reorganized 1,000-foot view of module layout showing the new combined functions and order)? That would make implementing these changes easier while preserving your verbose commenting style.
