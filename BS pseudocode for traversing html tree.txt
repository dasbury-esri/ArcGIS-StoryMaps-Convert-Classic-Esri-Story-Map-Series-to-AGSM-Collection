# Pseudocode for traversing html tree
# get all leaf nodes
# if node is a leaf node (no children)
#     recursively check its parents until the parent is equal to the root node.
#     step down one level
#     check for img, video, audio, iframe, embed, map tags
#     if no other tags found, mark as text node
#     if img, video, audio, iframe, embed, map tag found mark as that type
#     traverse up tree until a <p>, <div> or <span>is found
#     once a <p> is found, check if its parent is a <div class=image-container>, if so mark as Image()
#     once a <div> is found, check if its parent is a <Figure class=caption>, if so process as Image() with caption
#     once a <span> is found, check if its parent is a <span>
#     otherwise, capture all descendant tags and process the node as its marked type (Text | Image | Video | Audio | Embed | Map | Button | Code | Table)
